Splunk platform requirements
----------------------------
Because this add-on runs on the Splunk platform, all of the system requirements apply for the Splunk software that you use to run this add-on.

For Splunk Enterprise system requirements, see `System Requirements`_ in the Splunk Enterprise Installation Manual.
If you plan to run this add-on entirely in Splunk Cloud, there are no additional Splunk platform requirements.
If you are managing on-premises forwarders to get data into Splunk Cloud, see `System Requirements`_ in the Splunk Enterprise Installation Manual, which includes information about forwarders.
